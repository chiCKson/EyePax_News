# EyePaxNews - Android App 



EyePaxNews  is a reasonably decent news app for Android. It sources its news from [News Api](https://newsapi.org) along with hundreds of sources both local and nationwide. The UI is serviceable and clean and you can find news on a variety of topics, including sports, entertainment, travel, technology, and more. It’s not the best for politics, but it’s better than most. The app is entirely free with ads. The ads are a bit annoying, but it’s nothing too serious.

UI is from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/975336242667665188) designer [botpablo](https://www.figma.com/@botpablo)
